These are the files needed tosolve the exercise "multiroots" and the produced figures. The following message is printede on the screen:
Number of iterations: 274
Rosenbrock minimum: (1,1).
Analytic result: (1,1)
rmax: 8, E=-0.499975

rmax: 10, E=-0.499999


In both cases, the ground state is estimated fairly well, and the curves lie exactly on top of each other except close to rmax.
