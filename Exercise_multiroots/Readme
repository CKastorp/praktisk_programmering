These are the files needed tosolve the exercise "multiroots" and the produced figures. The following message is printede on the screen:
Number of iterations: 274
Rosenbrock minimum: (1,1).
Analytic result: (1,1)
rmax: 8, E=-0.74989

rmax: 10, E=-0.82639


In both cases, the ground state is estimated way below the actual result, and the proposed states oscillate wildly. This is not a good estimate forthe hydrogen ground state.
