This folder contains all files needed to solve the exercise "orbit- odeiv" and the figures it produces.

In the first exercise (logistic_plot.svg) the function does reproduce the behaviour of the logistic function, where the growth goes to a halt, when the value approaches 1.
The second exercise (orbit.svg) works as intended, except that the figure is visually skew(x and y not to scale).
