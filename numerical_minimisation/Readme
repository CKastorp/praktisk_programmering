The files needed to solve the nummerical methods exercise "multidimentional minimisation" part A and B i, i, and iii (hence 0.75 points).
When comparing the number of iterations for various algorithms, it becomes clear that the Newtonian minimisation, where the Hessian matrix is being provided, is the fastest, while symmetric rank 1-Broyden update is comparabe to root finding in the derivatve.
