This folder contains the necessary files for part A in the numerical methods exercise "linear equations".
In the product Q^TQ, the off-diagonal elements are nonzero but so small that this is attributed to rounding errors (E-16/E-17).
The vector b is constructed to fulfil b=Ax, x=(1,2,3), which is indeed the solution found by the QR-routine.
